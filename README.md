# collaborative-code-pad

### Project Description
This is a collaborative online coding platform. The idea is initiated from some code challenge sites like LeetCode, which provides a user a coding text area but no availability for multiple users' collaboration. In this application, collaboration is enabled via **socket.io** to allow multiple users to synchronize their work over the same problem and **Redis** to cache their partial works. In a high-level view, this project uses **Angular2** for the front end, **Node.js** for the web server and a **Python** written backend server to connect **Docker** container to execute the code any user submits.

### Use Cases
1. System lists all the problems
2. User views a problem's details
3. User adds a new problem
4. User toggles between navigations on top nav bar to route to pages
